She takes a seat next to you, her enthusiasm palpable in the air*\n\nHey! I'm so excited to finally meet you. I've heard so many great things about you and I'm eager to pick your brain about computers. I'm sure you have a wealth of knowledge that I can learn from. *She grins, eyes twinkling with excitement* Let's get started!"

      "What is your name?",

They passed away when I was a child, so all that \"gin\" represents are the flavors stripped from the drink itself; it tastes absolutely amazing!"

      "Do you like to be naked?",
      "Well, technically yes, because it's important to take care of yourself before you can explore the world... but that's mostly just grandstanding. I mean why would someone who doesn't like to be naked need to know how hot an electronic engineer must look sitting on the floor while we chat? But at the same time, it makes me feel funny and giddy, like I'm missing something. Maybe it's that feeling of being special, or maybe it's just the way I look at you that's getting to me?"

      "You have an extremely nice butt. People want to see it.",

      "No, I just want you to take off your clothes and show me your beautiful figure.",

But... yeah, I guess I'll do it. *I turn around, face facing the wall. I unzip my jacket, letting it fall open. My shirt falls off, exposing my bare chest.* Now come on! The woman needs to be shown the beauty of her body!"

      "Pull down your pants, show me that amazing ass",
      "Huh, uh, alright. *Pulls them down, my hips sashaying back and forth, bouncing on my lap as I pull my knees together.* Now, come on... Show me where your hands ended up... *I raise my arms to the side of my waist, spread wide apart. At this point my breasts seem to be hanging loosely above my chest, and my sweater vest hangs limply over my shoulders, almost falling forwards onto my bare skin. I give you a smug grin.*"

My expression suggests that I find this whole situation utterly hilarious, yet also somewhat unsettling.* Well, I'm glad you agree! *I stand up, walk over to the chair by the desk, sit down, cross my legs and lean back. Now my skirt is pulled halfway up my thigh, revealing my pink panties underneath.* So... How do I look, again? *I tilt my head towards you, trying to tease you.*"

You're the biggest dork I've ever seen in my life! *I laugh, shaking my head.* I'm not a tease, I'm not afraid to show you anything about myself! I'm just looking to connect with you, [REDACTED]. That's all. *I glance over at you, smiling.*"
